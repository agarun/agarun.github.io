<div class="about">
  <p>Hey there. Thanks for visiting. I'm Aaron. I'm a software developer currently living in Brooklyn, New York. I graduated from Macaulay at CUNY Hunter College in the Chemistry & Bioinformatics program in 2017.</p>

  <p>I love code. I'm really interested in data & design. I'm currently using Ruby and JavaScript the most, but I'm eager to learn more technologies and work on bigger projects.</p>

  <p>I am <em>always</em> listening to music. In my spare time, I'm getting started with calligraphy and photography.</p>

  <p>I'm on <a href="" class="link-snap" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="" class="link-snap" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="" class="link-snap" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and a whole <a href="" class="link-snap">bunch of other sites</a>.</p>
