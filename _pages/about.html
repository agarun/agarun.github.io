  <p>Hey there, thanks for visiting!</p>

  <p>My name is Aaron and I'm a software developer in Brooklyn, New York. I studied chemistry and bioinformatics at Hunter College.</p>

  <p>I'm a passionate coder interested in data and design. I care deeply about engaging creative challenges. I'm currently writing the most in Ruby and JavaScript, but I'm always eager to work on new projects.</p>

  <p>I am <a href="/posts/loved-lists/" class="link-snap"><em>always</em></a> listening to music. In my spare time, I'm getting deeper into calligraphy and generative art.</p>

  <p>I've been working on a few <a href="/projects/" class="link-snap">projects</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm on <a href="https://github.com/agarun" class="link-snap" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/agarunov/" class="link-snap" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and a <a href="/contact/" class="link-snap">bunch of other sites</a>.<br>
  Feel free to <a href="mailto:agarunov.aaron@gmail.com" class="link-snap">send me an email</a>.</p>
